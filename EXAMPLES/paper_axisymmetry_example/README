This example contains the example shown in the paper:

Bottero Alexis, Cristini Paul, Komatitsch Dimitri, Asch Mark. An axisymmetric time-domain spectral-element
method for full-wave simulations: Application to ocean acoustics. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 140, 3520 (2016).

 This is how it looks:

By default: lx = 15000.0m, lz = 3000.0m, d1 = 600.0m, d2 = 100.0m, l1 = 2000.0m, l2 = 6000.0m

It uses of AXISYM option with an external mesh whose files under specfem2d format are already available in MESH_SMALL.
This mesh has been created with Cubit/Trelis (http://www.csimsoft.com/trelis) with the script JensenMesh.py which is called by
make_mesh.sh. Have a look to the comments in these files if you want to recreate the mesh or just to learn how it is done.

In this example the domain studied is a water layer lying above a viscoelastic seabed with a slope.
The source is an explosion in the water, the domain is bounded with PMLs below and at the right.

This example is defined by two files : _Par_file -> contains all the parameters of the run + receivers positions
                                       _SOURCE   -> contains the information about the source

To run the example, type:

  ./run_this_example.sh
  
in this directory. This script is designed for serial and parallel simulations. If specfem2d has been built correctly (with --with-mpi option) 
just change the number of processes in Par_file_axisym.

Then see the results in OUTPUT_FILES/.

In the article the results are compared in term of transmission losses at 5Hz (frequency domain) with a commercial finite element
code (COMSOL) and a parabolic equation solver (ROTVARS).
For this purpose we have put 1000 receivers at z=-30m to compute transmission losses. This is done by the script make_comparison.sh
that has to be run after run_this_example.sh

To speed up the results the calculation are made at low resolution, you can obtain the number of receiver in the file Par_file (look for TODO)
If you change the number of receivers you will have to change the factor at the beginning of the script in make_comparison.sh
It is just a multiplying factor that set the reference.

To clean this directory : rm -rf OUTPUT_FILES/ x* *~
