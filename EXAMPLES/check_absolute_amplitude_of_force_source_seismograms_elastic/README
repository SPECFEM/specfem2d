This example runs a 2D P-SV plane strain benchmark for a vertical force source of maximum amplitude 1 Newton with a Ricker source time function in a homogeneous elastic medium,
and compares the displacement seismograms at a receiver to the analytical solution (computed using three different analytical codes, thus the Gnuplot
display script will display four curves). This benchmark allows us to check that the absolute amplitude of the seismograms is right.


TO RUN:

0. Read the user manual in SPECFEM2D/doc/manual_SPECFEM2D.pdf

1. in the SPECFEM2D root directory, configure, e.g.,
   ./configure FC=gfortran

2. compile:
   make all

3. cd EXAMPLES/check_absolute_amplitude_of_force_source_seismograms_elastic

4. execute script to run mesher and solver for the P-SV case:
   ./run_this_example.sh

5. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES; in particular, you can type "gnuplot plot_compare_to_analytical_solution.gnu" to compare the seismograms computed to the quasi-analytical solution of the problem.

Note that because our example has no absorbing conditions on the edges of the grid, there are extra (spurious) waves after the main P and S waves, reflected off the edges of the grid, which are not present in the quasi-analytical solution and which you can safely ignore.

Beware that the reference solution is not exact, only quasi-exact (i.e., the formulation uses an approximation, and some integrals are computed numerically) therefore some tiny discrepancies can be noticed.
