This example creates a simple mesh with circular inclusions with Gmsh.

requires:
 * Gmsh       - for downloading, see http://gmsh.info
 * numpy      - scientific computing with python, see http://www.numpy.org


tested for Gmsh 3.0.6, numpy 1.14.0

0. installation:
  
   - Gmsh:
       download Gmsh and install package (make sure that command gmsh is in your PATH)
       http://gmsh.info

1. to generate mesh, type:
    > cd MESH/
    > gmsh SqrCirc.geo -2 -order 2 -format msh22 -o SqrCirc.msh
    > python ../../../utils/Gmsh/LibGmsh2Specfem_convert_Gmsh_to_Specfem2D_official.py SqrCirc.msh -t F -l A -b A -r A
    > cd ../

   or for all of these steps, just run the script in this folder:
    > ./process_the_Gmsh_file_once_and_for_all.sh


2. run simulation:
    
   - run script:
     > ./run_this_example.sh


Compare your seismograms in OUTPUT_FILES/ with the reference ones in directory REF_SEIS/

NOTE:
  The mesh files provided in this example have been created originally by Paul Cristini with a now outdated Gmsh version.
  Re-creating the mesh with the provided *.geo file will likely produce another mesh with the current Gmsh version.

  Still, we provide here the original mesh files as they work nicely with a larger DT step size.
