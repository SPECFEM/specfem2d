Example for Tromp-Tape-Liu (GJI 2005)

The example currently only generates the (synthetic) seismograms associated with the PSV example in Figure 7b and the SH example in Figure 2b.

Demonstration of the kernel calculation is not yet added here.

(The subscript s100 for the input files corresponds to the same set of simulations but scaled down in size by a factor of 100. This requires increasing the source frequency content and decreasing the time step; these changes are shown in the alternative files.)

---------------------------

The examples in Tromp-Tape-Liu (GJI 2005) assume a simulation start time of t=0, and a source start time of t = t0 = 8.0 s. SPECFEM2D assumes that the simulation starts at t = -t0 and the source start time is t = 0. Thus, USER_T0 is set to 8.0 in the Par_file

TO RUN:

0. Read the user manual in SPECFEM2D/doc/manual_SPECFEM2D.pdf

1. in SPECFEM2D root directory, configure, e.g.,
   ./configure FC=gfortran

2. compile:
   make all

3. cd EXAMPLES/Tromp2005/

4. execute script to run mesher and solver for the PSV case:
   ./process.sh

5. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES

   The seismograms (S0001.AA.BXX.semd,S0001.AA.BXZ.semd) will be similar to those in Tromp2005, Figure 7b, but with an 8-second time shift due to the difference in origin time convention.

6. mv OUTPUT_FILES OUTPUT_FILES_PSV

7. set p_sv = .false. in Par_file_Tromp2005

8. execute script to run mesher and solver for the SH case:
   ./process.sh

9. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES

   The seismogram (S0001.AA.BXY.semd) will be similar to those in Tromp2005, Figure 2b, but with an 8-second time shift due to the difference in origin time convention.
