This bug occurs in simulations with many time steps and viscoelastic media with PMLs. Even if the PMLs are not in contact with
the viscoelastic part!!

Appart from the explosion in the PMLs one can see:
_An important amount of energy reflected at the PMLs at the beginning of the run
_The spots already discussed in bugPMLs_1
