- bugPMLs_1 : Strong spurious reflection from the left PML (see the green circle in the picture included).

- bugPMLs_2 : Weak instability slowly developing in long times. This problem (the worst by far) occurs in simulations with many time steps (> 100000) and viscoelastic media with PMLs. Even if the PMLs are not in contact with the viscoelastic part!
