This example reads in a Vp velocity model given in SEP (Stanford Exploration Project) file format
and interpolates it onto a regular SPECFEM2D mesh to produce seismic traces.

1. modify interpolate.f90
   mainly to change the location/names of your SEP/SU models

2. run interpolation:
   ./run_this_example.sh

   The script will compile the interpolate.f90 file and run the xinterpolate binary.
   This binary will call the mesher xmeshfem2D and solver xspecfem2D to first create and output the regular mesh,
   then interpolate the velocities onto it and re-run the binaries to run a simulation using the
   interpolated velocity model (in "legacy" format).
