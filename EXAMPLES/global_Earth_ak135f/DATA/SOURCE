## Source type parameters:
#  1 = elastic force or acoustic pressure
#  2 = moment tensor
# or Initial field type (when initialfield set in Par_file):
# For a plane wave including converted and reflected waves at the free surface:
#  1 = P wave,
#  2 = S wave,
#  3 = Rayleigh wave
# For a plane wave without converted nor reflected waves at the free surface, i.e. with the incident wave only:

# Source time function:
# In the case of a source located in an acoustic medium,
# to get pressure for a Ricker in the seismograms, here we need to select a Gaussian for the potential Chi
# used as a source, rather than a Ricker, because pressure = - Chi_dot_dot.
# This is true both when USE_TRICK_FOR_BETTER_PRESSURE is set to .true. or to .false.
# Options:
#  1 = second derivative of a Gaussian (a.k.a. Ricker),
#  2 = first derivative of a Gaussian,
#  3 = Gaussian,
#  4 = Dirac,
#  5 = Heaviside (4 and 5 will produce noisy recordings because of frequencies above the mesh resolution limit),
#  6 = ocean acoustics type I,
#  7 = ocean acoustics type II,
#  8 = external source time function = 8 (source read from file),
#  9 = burst,
