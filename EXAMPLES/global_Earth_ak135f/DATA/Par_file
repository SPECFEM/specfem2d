#
# For istropic elastic/acoustic material use I and set Vs to zero to make a given model acoustic, for anisotropic elastic use II,
# and for isotropic poroelastic material use III. The mesh can contain acoustic, elastic, and poroelastic models simultaneously.
#
# For anisotropic media in the most general 2D case we have the following convention for the stress-strain relationship:
# ! implement anisotropy in 2D
# sigma_xx = c11*dux_dx + c13*duz_dz + c15*(duz_dx + dux_dz)
# sigma_zz = c13*dux_dx + c33*duz_dz + c35*(duz_dx + dux_dz)
# sigma_xz = c15*dux_dx + c35*duz_dz + c55*(duz_dx + dux_dz)
# sigma_yy is not equal to zero in the plane strain formulation
# but is used only in post-processing if needed,
# to compute pressure for display or seismogram recording purposes
# sigma_yy = c12*dux_dx + c23*duz_dz + c25*(duz_dx + dux_dz)
# where the notations are for instance duz_dx = d(Uz) / dx.
#
# For anisotropic elastic media the last three parameters, c12 c23 c25, are used only when the user asks the code to compute pressure for display
# or seismogram recording purposes. Thus, if you do not know these parameters for your anisotropic material and/or if you do not plan to display or record pressure you
# can ignore them and set them to zero. When pressure is used these three parameters are needed because the code needs to compute sigma_yy,
# which is not equal to zero in the plane strain formulation.
