This simulation uses a visco-acoustic simulation, thus setting attenuation ATTENUATION_VISCOACOUSTIC = .true.

The source here uses an amplification factor of 4* PI * vp**2 = 4 * PI * (2000)**2 = 50264000.0
This is due to a factor difference between the source definitions in Carcione.

The convention used by Carcione in his 1988 paper is to use a source of amplitude 4 * PI * cp^2, 
while in SPECFEM it is to have amplitude 1.

Note: The reference code provided in attenuation_viscoacoustic_NSLS_3/ folder is not correcting for this.
      While the code provided in check_absolute_amplitude_of_pressure_source_seismograms_acoustic/analytical_solution_viscoacoustic_Carcione_version1.f90
      is dividing the source by 4 * PI * cp^2 to get the right amplitude directly.
