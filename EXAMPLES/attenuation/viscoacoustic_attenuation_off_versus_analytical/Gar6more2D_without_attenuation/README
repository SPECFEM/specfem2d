This software is a computer program whose purpose is to
compute the analytical solution of problems of waves propagation in two 
layered media in 2D such as
- acoustic/acoustic
- acoustic/elastodynamic
- acoustic/porous
- porous/porous,
based on the Cagniard-de Hoop method.

                      Short Description of the code
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I) The main program is lib/bin/Gar6more2D.F90.

II) The directory mod/ contains all files for the declaration of the common 
variables.

III) The directory lib/libgeneral contains functions used by most of the 
subroutines : the source function source.F90, the computation of the path 
in the complex plane path.F90, the computation of the derivate dp/dt 
derivee.F90 and the computation of the reflexion and transmission coefficients
for acoustic/poroelatic (calcoeff_ap.F90) and poroelastic/poroelastic 
(calcoefff_pp.F90 (fast wave) and calcoeffs_app.F90 (slow wave)).

IV) The directory includefic contains the interface files.

V) The directory lib/acousacous contains the subroutines for the computation 
of the incident wave (sub_incid_aa.F90), the reflected wave 
(sub_reflex_aa.F90) and the transmitted wave (sub_transmit_aa.F90) in the 
acoustic/acoustic case. 

VI) The directory lib/acouselasto contains the subroutines for the computation
of the incident wave (sub_incid_ae.F90), the reflected wave 
(sub_reflex_ae.F90), the transmitted P wave (sub_transmitp_ae.F90) and the 
transmitted S wave (sub_transmits_ae.F90) in the acoustic/elastodynamic case.

VII) The directory lib/acousporo contains the subroutines for the computation 
of the incident wave (sub_incid_ap.F90), the reflected wave 
(sub_reflex_ap.F90), the transmitted fast wave (sub_transmitf_ap.F90), 
the transmitted psi wave (sub_transmitpsi_ap.F90) and the transmitted 
slow wave (sub_transmits_ap.F90) in the acoustic/poroelastic case.

VIII) The directory lib/poroporo contains the subroutines for the computation 
of the incident wave (sub_incid_aa.F90), the reflected ff wave 
(sub_reflexff_pp.F90), the reflected fpsi wave (sub_reflexfpsi_pp.F90), 
the reflected fs wave (sub_reflexfs_pp.F90), the reflected sf wave 
(sub_reflexsf_pp.F90), the reflected spsi wave (sub_reflexspsi_pp.F90), 
the reflected ss wave (sub_reflexss_pp.F90), the transmitted ff wave 
(sub_transmitff_pp.F90), the transmitted fpsi wave (sub_transmitfpsi_pp.F90), 
the transmitted fs wave (sub_transmitfs_pp.F90), the transmitted sf wave 
(sub_transmitsf_pp.F90), the transmitted spsi wave (sub_transmitspsi_pp.F90) 
and the transmitted ss wave (sub_transmitss_pp.F90) in the 
poroelastic/poroelastic case.
