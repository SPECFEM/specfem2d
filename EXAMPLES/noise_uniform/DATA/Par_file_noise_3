# where the notations are for instance duz_dx = d(Uz) / dx.
#
# For anisotropic elastic media the last three parameters, c12 c23 c25, are used only when the user asks the code to compute pressure for display
# or seismogram recording purposes. Thus, if you do not know these parameters for your anisotropic material and/or if you do not plan to display or record pressure you
# can ignore them and set them to zero. When pressure is used these three parameters are needed because the code needs to compute sigma_yy,
# which is not equal to zero in the plane strain formulation.

# Ability to run several calculations (several earthquakes)

# this can be useful when using a very large supercomputer to compute
# many earthquakes in a catalog, in which case it can be better from
# a batch job submission point of view to start fewer and much larger jobs,
# each of them computing several earthquakes in parallel.
# To turn that option on, set parameter NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS to a value greater than 1.
# To implement that, we create NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS MPI sub-communicators,
# each of them being labeled "my_local_mpi_comm_world", and we use them
# in all the routines in "src/shared/parallel.f90", except in MPI_ABORT() because in that case
# we need to kill the entire run.
# When that option is on, of course the number of processor cores used to start
# the code in the batch system must be a multiple of NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS,
# all the individual runs must use the same number of processor cores,
# which as usual is NPROC in the Par_file,
# and thus the total number of processor cores to request from the batch system
# should be NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS * NPROC.
# All the runs to perform must be placed in directories called run0001, run0002, run0003 and so on
# (with exactly four digits).
#
# Imagine you have 10 independent calculations to do, each of them on 100 cores; you have three options:
#
# 1/ submit 10 jobs to the batch system
#
# 2/ submit a single job on 1000 cores to the batch, and in that script create a sub-array of jobs to start 10 jobs,
# each running on 100 cores (see e.g. http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/job_array.html )
#
# 3/ submit a single job on 1000 cores to the batch, start SPECFEM2D on 1000 cores, create 10 sub-communicators,
# cd into one of 10 subdirectories (called e.g. run0001, run0002,... run0010) depending on the sub-communicator
# your MPI rank belongs to, and run normally on 100 cores using that sub-communicator.
#

# if we perform simultaneous runs in parallel, if only the source and receivers vary between these runs
# but not the mesh nor the model (velocity and density) then we can also read the mesh and model files
# from a single run in the beginning and broadcast them to all the others; for a large number of simultaneous
# runs for instance when solving inverse problems iteratively this can DRASTICALLY reduce I/Os to disk in the solver
# (by a factor equal to NUMBER_OF_SIMULTANEOUS_RUNS), and reducing I/Os is crucial in the case of huge runs.
# Thus, always set this option to .true. if the mesh and the model are the same for all simultaneous runs.
# In that case there is no need to duplicate the mesh and model file database (the content of the DATABASES_MPI
