\chapter{Introduction}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

SPECFEM2D facilitates 2D simulations of
acoustic, (an)elastic, and poroelastic seismic wave propagation.
With version 6.2, the 2D spectral-element solver accommodates
regular and unstructured meshes, generated for example by Cubit
\urlwithparentheses{http://cubit.sandia.gov},
Gmsh \urlwithparentheses{http://geuz.org/gmsh}
or GiD \urlwithparentheses{http://www.gid.cimne.upc.es}.
Even mesh creation packages that generate triangles, for instance Delaunay-Voronoi triangulation codes, can be used because each triangle can then easily be decomposed into three quadrangles by linking the barycenter to the center of each edge; while this approach does not generate quadrangles of optimal quality, it can ease mesh creation in some situations and it has been shown that the spectral-element method can very accurately handle distorted mesh elements.\\

The solver has adjoint capabilities and can
calculate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels for acoustic,
(an)elastic, and poroelastic media. The package also considers 2D SH
and P-SV wave propagation. Finally, the solver can run
both in serial and in parallel. See SPECFEM2D
\urlwithparentheses{http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/software/packages/seismo/specfem2d}
for the source code.\\

The SEM is a continuous Galerkin technique, which can easily be made discontinous \citep{BeMaPa94,Ch00,KoWoHu02,ChCaVi03,LaWaBe05,Kop06,WiStBuGh10,AcKo11}; it is then close to a particular case of the discontinuous Galerkin technique \citep{ReHi73,Arn82,FaRi99,HuHuRa99,CoKaSh00,GiHeWa02,RiWh03,MoRi05,GrScSc06,AiMoMu06,BeLaPi06,DuKa06,DeSeWh08,PuAmKa09,WiStBuGh10,DeSe10,EtChViGl10}, with optimized efficiency because of its tensorized basis functions \citep{WiStBuGh10,AcKo11}.
In particular, it can accurately handle very distorted mesh elements \citep{OlSe11}.\\

It has very good accuracy and convergence properties \citep{MaPa89,SePr94,DeFiMu02,Coh02,DeSe07,SeOl08}.
The spectral element approach admits spectral rates of convergence and allows exploiting $hp$-convergence schemes.
It is also very well suited to parallel implementation on very large supercomputers \citep{KoTr02a,KoTsChTr03,TsKoChTr03,KoLaMi08a,CaKoLaTiMiLeSnTr08,KoViCh10} as well as on clusters of GPU accelerating graphics cards \citep{KoMiEr09,KoErGoMi10,Kom11}. Tensor products inside each element can be optimized to reach very high efficiency \citep{DeFiMu02}, and mesh point and element numbering can be optimized to reduce processor cache misses and improve cache reuse \citep{KoLaMi08a}. The SEM can also handle triangular (in 2D) or tetrahedral (in 3D) elements \citep{WinBoyd96,TaWi00,KoMaTrTaWi01,Coh02,MeViSa06} as well as mixed meshes, although with increased cost and reduced accuracy in these elements, as in the discontinuous Galerkin method.\\

Note that in many geological models in the context of seismic wave propagation studies
(except for instance for fault dynamic rupture studies, in which very high frequencies or supershear rupture need to be modeled near the fault, see e.g. \cite{BeGlCrViPi07,BeGlCrVi09,PuAmKa09,TaCrEtViBeSa10})
a continuous formulation is sufficient because material property contrasts are not drastic and thus
conforming mesh doubling bricks can efficiently handle mesh size variations \citep{KoTr02a,KoLiTrSuStSh04,LeChLiKoHuTr08,LeChKoHuTr09,LeKoHuTr09}.\\

For a detailed introduction to the SEM as applied to regional
seismic wave propagation, please consult \citet{KoVi98,KoTr99,ChKoViCaVaFe07,TrKoLi08} and
in particular \citet{KoLiTrSuStSh04}.
A detailed theoretical analysis of the dispersion
and stability properties of the SEM is available in \citet{Coh02}, \citet{DeSe07} and \citet{SeOl07}.\\

The SEM was originally developed in computational fluid dynamics \citep{Pat84,MaPa89}
and has been successfully adapted to address problems in seismic wave propagation.
Early seismic wave propagation applications of the SEM, utilizing Legendre basis functions and a
perfectly diagonal mass matrix, include \cite{CoJoTo93}, \cite{Kom97},
\cite{FaMaPaQu97}, \cite{CaGa97}, \cite{KoVi98} and \cite{KoTr99},
whereas applications involving Chebyshev basis functions and a nondiagonal mass matrix
include \cite{SePr94}, \cite{PrCaSe94} and \cite{SePrPr95}.\\

All SPECFEM2D software is written in Fortran90 with full portability
in mind, and conforms strictly to the Fortran95 standard. It uses
no obsolete or obsolescent features of Fortran77. The package uses
parallel programming based upon the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
\citep{GrLuSk94,Pac97}.\\

The next release of the code will include support for GPU graphics card acceleration \citep{KoMiEr09,KoErGoMi10,MiKo10,Kom11}
as well as Convolutional or Auxiliary Differential Equation Perfectly Matched absorbing Layers (C-PML or ADE-PML) \citep{KoMa07,MaKoEz08,MaKoGe08,MaKo09,MaKoGeBr10}.\\

\chapter{\label{cha:Getting-Started}Getting Started}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

The SPECFEM2D software package comes in a gzipped tar ball. In the
directory in which you want to install the package, type
\begin{lyxcode}
{\small tar~-zxvf~SPECFEM2D\_6.2.0.tar.gz}{\small \par}
\end{lyxcode}
The directory \texttt{SPECFEM2D-6.2.0/} will then contain
the source code. In the following, we will refer to this directory as the root directory \texttt{SPECFEM2D/}. \\

To configure the software for your system, run the
\texttt{configure} shell script. This script will attempt to guess
the appropriate configuration values for your system. However, at
a minimum, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the appropriate
command names for your Fortran90 compiler:
\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~FC=ifort~
\end{lyxcode}


\noindent
To optimize compilation of the executables on your specific system, please follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}

\item if you want to run in parallel, i.e., using more than one processor core, then you would type
\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~FC=ifort~MPIFC=mpif90~-{}-with-mpi
\end{lyxcode}

The SPECFEM2D software package relies on the SCOTCH library to partition meshes.
The SCOTCH library \citep{PeRo96}
provides efficent static mapping, graph and mesh partitioning routines. SCOTCH is a free software package developed by
Fran\c {c}ois Pellegrini et al. from LaBRI and INRIA in Bordeaux, France, downloadable from the web page \url{https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/scotch/}. It is more recent than METIS, actively maintained and performs better in many cases.
A recent version of its source code is provided in directory \texttt{scotch\_5.1.11/}.
In case no SCOTCH libraries can be found on the system, the configuration will bundle this version for compilation.
The path to an existing SCOTCH installation can to be set explicitly with the option \texttt{-{}-with-scotch-dir}.
Just as an example:
\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~FC=ifort~MPIFC=mpif90~-{}-with-mpi~-{}-with-scotch-dir=/opt/scotch
\end{lyxcode}

If you use the Intel ifort compiler to compile the code, we recommend that you use the Intel icc C compiler to compile Scotch, i.e., use:
\begin{lyxcode}
./configure~CC=icc~FC=ifort~MPIFC=mpif90
\end{lyxcode}

For further details about the installation of SCOTCH,
go to subdirectory \texttt{scotch\_5.1.11/} and read \texttt{INSTALL.txt}. You may want to download more recent versions of SCOTCH in the future from \urlwithparentheses{http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/scotch_en.html} . Support for the METIS graph partitioner has been discontinued because SCOTCH is more recent and performs better.

\item edit the \texttt{Makefile} for more specific modifications. Especially, there are several options available :\\
\texttt{-DUSE\_MPI} compiles with use of an MPI library. \\
\texttt{-DUSE\_SCOTCH} enables use of graph partitioner SCOTCH.


\end{itemize}
After these steps, go back to the main directory of SPECFEM2D/ and type
\begin{lyxcode}
make
\end{lyxcode}
to create all executables which will be placed into the folder \texttt{./bin/}.

\chapter{Mesh Generation}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{How to use SPECFEM2D}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{figures/workflow.jpg}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Schematic workflow for a SPECFEM2D simulation. The exectable \texttt{xmeshfem2D} creates the GLL mesh points and assigns specific model parameters. The executable \texttt{xspecfem2D} solves the seismic wave propagation.}

\label{fig:workflow.databases}
\end{figure}


\noindent
To run the mesher, please follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item edit the input file \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} which describes the simulation. It contains comments and should be almost self-explanatory, if you need more details we do not have a manual for the 2D version but you can find useful information in the manuals of the 3D versions, since many parameters and the general philosophy is similar. They are available at
\urlwithparentheses{http://geodynamics.org/wsvn/cig/seismo/3D} in subdirectories \texttt{USER\_MANUAL/}. To create acoustic (fluid) regions, just set the S wave speed to zero and the code will see that these elements are fluid and switch to the right equations there automatically, and automatically match them with the solid regions

\item if you are using an external mesher (like GID or CUBIT), you should set \texttt{read\_external\_mesh} to \texttt{.true.}:
	\begin{description}
     \item[\texttt{mesh\_file}] is the file describing the mesh : first line is the number of elements, then a list of 4 nodes (quadrilaterals only) forming each elements on each line.

     \item[\texttt{nodes\_coords\_file}] is the file containing the coordinates (x and z) of each nodes : number of nodes on the first line, then coordinates x and z on each line.

     \item[\texttt{materials\_file}] is the number of the material for every elements : an integer ranging from 1 to nbmodels on each line.

     \item[\texttt{free\_surface\_file}] is the file describing the edges forming the acoustic free surface : number of edges on the first line, then on each line number of the element, number of nodes forming the free surface (1 for a point, 2 for an edge), the nodes forming the free surface for this element. If you do not want free surface, just put 0 on the first line.

     \item[\texttt{absorbing\_surface\_file}] is the file describing the edges forming the absorbing boundaries : the format is the same as the \texttt{free\_surface\_file}.

     \item[\texttt{tangential\_detection\_curve\_file}] contains points describing the envelope, used for \texttt{source\_normal\_to\_surface} and \texttt{rec\_normal\_to\_surface}. Should be fine grained, and ordained clockwise. Number of points on the first line, then (x,z) coordinates on each line.
	\end{description}

\item if you have compiled with MPI, you must specify the number of processes.

\end{itemize}
Then type
\begin{lyxcode}
./bin/xmeshfem2D
\end{lyxcode}
to create the mesh (which will be stored in directory \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/}). \texttt{xmeshfem2D} is serial; it will output several files called \texttt{Database??????}, one for each process.

%%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/example-gridfile.pdf}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Example of a grid file generated by \texttt{xmeshfem2D} and visualized with gnuplot
(within gnuplot, type `\texttt{plot "OUTPUT\_FILES/gridfile.gnu" w l}`).}
\label{fig:example.mesh}
\end{figure}
%%


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Controlling the quality of an external mesh}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

To examine the quality of the elements in your externally build mesh, type
\begin{lyxcode}
./bin/xcheck\_quality\_external\_mesh
\end{lyxcode}
(and answer "3" to the first question asked).
This code will tell you which element in the whole mesh has the worst quality (maximum skewness, i.e. maximum deformation of the element angles) and it should be enough to modify this element with the external software package used for the meshing, and
to repeat the operation until the maximum skewness of the whole mesh is less or equal to about 0.75 (above is dangerous: from 0.75 to 0.80 could still work, but if there is a single element above 0.80 the mesh should be improved).

The code also shows a histogram of 20 classes of skewness which tells how many element are above the skewness = 0.75, and to which percentage of the total this amounts. To see this histogram, you could type:
\begin{lyxcode}
gnuplot plot\_mesh\_quality\_histogram.gnu
\end{lyxcode}
This tool is useful to estimate the mesh quality and to see it evolve along the successive corrections.




%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\chapter{Running the Solver xspecfem2D}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

To run the solver, type:
\begin{lyxcode}
./bin/xspecfem2D
\end{lyxcode}
to run the main solver (use \texttt{mpirun} or equivalent if you compiled with parallel support). This will output the seismograms and snapshots of the wave fronts at different time steps in directory \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/}. To visualize them, type "\texttt{gs OUTPUT\_FILES/vect*.ps}" to see the Postscript files (in which the wave field is represented with small arrows, fluid/solid matching interfaces with a thick pink line, and absorbing edges with a thick green line) and "\texttt{gimp OUTPUT\_FILES/image*.gif}" to see the color snapshot showing a pixelized image of one of the two components of the wave field (or pressure, depending on what you have selected for the output in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}).


%%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/image0000300.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/image0000400.jpg}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{figures/image0000500.jpg}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Wavefield snapshots of the default example generated by \texttt{xspecfem2D} when parameter \texttt{output\_color\_image} is set to \texttt{.true.}.}
\label{fig:example.solver}
\end{figure}
%%

\noindent
Please consider these following points, when running the solver:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} given with the code works fine, you can use it without any modification to test the code

\item the seismograms \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/*.sem*} are simple ASCII files with two columns: time in the first colum and amplitude in the second, therefore they can be visualized with any tool you like, for instance "\texttt{gnuplot}"

\item if you set flag \texttt{assign\_external\_model} to \texttt{.true.} in \texttt{DATA/Par\_file}, the velocity and density model that is given at the end of \texttt{DATA/Par\_file} is then ignored and overwritten by the external velocity and density model that you define yourself in \texttt{define\_external\_model.f90}

\item when compiling with Intel ifort, use "\texttt{-assume byterecl}" option to create binary PNM images displaying the wave field

\item we do not have PML absorbing conditions implemented in the fluid/solid code yet. We use (older and less efficient) paraxial Clayton-Engquist or Sommerfeld equations instead. This is only by lack of time, we have a developer who is currently implementing PML but the code is not fully ready. For now, since the paraxial conditions are less efficient, please use a larger model

\item there are a few useful scripts and Fortran routines in directory \texttt{UTILS/}.

\item if you find bugs (or if you have comments or suggestions) please send an email to cig-seismo AT geodynamics.org and the developers will try to fix them and send you an updated version

\item you can find a Fortran code to compute the analytical solution for simple media that we use as a reference in benchmarks in many of our articles at
\urlwithparentheses{http://www.spice-rtn.org/library/software/EX2DDIR}. That code is described in: \cite{BeIfNiSk94}

\end{itemize}

\noindent
The \texttt{SOURCE} file located in the \texttt{DATA/} directory should be edited in the following way:
\begin{description}
\item[source\_surf] Set this flag to \texttt{.true.} to force the source to be located at the surface of the model, otherwise
the source will be placed inside the medium

\item[xs] source location x in meters

\item[zs] source location z in meters

\item[source\_type] Set this value equal to \texttt{1} for elastic forces or acoustic pressure,
set this to \texttt{2} for moment tensor sources.

\item[time\_function\_type] Choose a source-time function: set this value to \texttt{1} to use a Ricker,
\texttt{2} the first derivative, \texttt{3} a Gaussian, \texttt{4} a Dirac or \texttt{5} a Heaviside source-time function.

\item[f0] Set this to the dominant frequency of the source.
For point-source simulations using a Heaviside source-time function (time\_function\_type "5"),
we recommend setting the source frequency parameter \texttt{f0}
equal to a high value, which corresponds to simulating a step source-time
function, i.e., a moment-rate function that is a delta function.

The \texttt{half duration} of a source is obtained by \texttt{1/f0}.
If the code will use a Gaussian source-time function (time\_function\_type "3")
(i.e., a signal with a shape similar to a `smoothed triangle', as
explained in \citet{KoTr02a} and shown in Fig~\ref{fig:gauss.vs.triangle}), the
source-time function uses a half-width of \texttt{half duration}. We prefer
to run the solver with \texttt{half duration} set to zero and convolve
the resulting synthetic seismograms in post-processing after the run,
because this way it is easy to use a variety of source-time functions.
\citet{KoTr02a} determined
that the noise generated in the simulation by using a step source
time function may be safely filtered out afterward based upon a convolution
with the desired source time function and/or low-pass filtering. Use
the serial code \texttt{convolve\_source\_timefunction.f90} and the
script \texttt{convolve\_source\_timefunction.csh} for this purpose,
or alternatively use signal-processing software packages such as SAC \urlwithparentheses{www.llnl.gov/sac}.
Type
\begin{lyxcode}
make~convolve\_source\_timefunction
\end{lyxcode}
to compile the code and then set the parameter \texttt{hdur} in \texttt{convolve\_source\_timefunction.csh}
to the desired half-duration.
%%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/gauss_vs_triangle_mod.eps}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Comparison of the shape of a triangle and the Gaussian function actually
used.}
\label{fig:gauss.vs.triangle}
\end{figure}
%%

\item[t0] For single sources, we recommend to set the time shift parameter \texttt{t0} equal to $0.0$.
The time shift parameter would simply apply
an overall time shift to the synthetics (according to the time shift of the first source), something that can be done
in the post-processing. This time shift parameter can be non-zero when using multiple sources.

\item[angleforce] Angle of the source (for a force only)

\item[Mxx,Mzz,Mxz] Moment tensor components (valid only for moment tensor sources, source\_type "2").
Note that the units for the components of a moment tensor source are different in SPECFEM2D and in SPECFEM3D:
\begin{description}
\item[SPECFEM3D:] in SPECFEM3D the moment tensor components are in dyne*cm
\item[SPECFEM2D:] in SPECFEM2D the moment tensor components are in N*m
\end{description}

\item[factor] amplification factor

\end{description}
Note, the zero time of the simulation corresponds to the center of the triangle/Gaussian,
or the centroid time of the earthquake. The start time of the simulation
is $t=-1.2*\texttt{half duration} + \texttt{t0}$ (the factor 1.2 is to make sure the moment
rate function is very close to zero when starting the simulation; Heaviside functions use a factor 2.0),
the half duration is obtained by 1/f0.
If you prefer, you can fix this start time by setting the parameter \texttt{USER\_T0} in the \texttt{constants.h} file
to a positive, non-zero value. The simulation in that case would start at a starting time equal to \texttt{-USER\_T0}.

\subsection*{Caution}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

See file \texttt{todo\_list\_please\_dont\_remove.txt} for a list of known bugs, problems, or missing options.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\subsection*{Coupled Simulations}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

The code supports acoustic/elastic, acoustic/poroelastic, elastic/poroelastic,
and acoustic,elastic/poroelastic simulations.\\

\noindent
Elastic/poroelastic coupling supports anisotropy, but not attenuation for the
elastic material.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{How to run P-SV or SH (membrane) wave simulations}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

For elastic materials, you have these additional options:
\begin{description}
\item[P-SV:]
To run a P-SV waves calculation propagating in the x-z plane,
set \texttt{p\_sv = .true.} in the \texttt{Par\_file}.

\item[SH:]
To run a SH (membrane) waves calculation traveling in the x-z plane with a
y-component of motion, set \texttt{p\_sv = .false.}

\end{description}
This feature is only implemented for elastic materials and sensitivity kernels
can be calculated (see \cite{TaLiTr07} for details on membrane
surface waves).


A useful Python script called \texttt{SEM\_save\_dir.py}, written by Paul Cristini from
Laboratoire de Mecanique et d'Acoustique, CNRS, Marseille, France, is provided.
It allows one to automatically save all the parameters and results of a given simulation.




%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{How to use Poroelasticity}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

Check the following new inputs in \texttt{Par\_file}:
\begin{description}
\item In section {\bf "\# geometry of model and mesh description"}:\\
\texttt{TURN\_VISCATTENUATION\_ON}, \texttt{Q0}, and \texttt{FREQ0} deal with viscous damping in a poroelastic medium.
\texttt{Q0} is the quality factor set at the central frequency \texttt{FREQ0}. For more details
see \cite{MoTr08}.

\item In section {\bf "\# time step parameters"}:\\
\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE} defines the type of simulations \\
(1) forward simulation \\
(2) adjoint method and kernels calculation

\item In section {\bf "\# source parameters"}:\\
The code now support multi sources.
\texttt{NSOURCE} is the number of source.
Parameters of the sources are displayed in the file \texttt{SOURCE}, which must be
in the directory \texttt{DATA/}. The components of a moment tensor source must be given in N.m,
not in dyne.cm as in the \texttt{DATA/CMTSOLUTION} source file of the 3D version of the code.

triangle is defined to be time zero. Note that this is NOT in general
the hypocentral time, or the start time of the source (marked as tstart).
The time shift parameter \texttt{t0} in the \texttt{SOURCE} file
would be t1(=0), t2, t3 in this case, and the half-duration parameter, resp. \texttt{f0},
would be hdur1=1/f0\_1, hdur2=1/f0\_2, hdur3=1/f0\_3 for the sources 1, 2, 3 respectively.}

\item In section {\bf "\# receiver line parameters for seismograms"}:\\
\texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} determines if the last frame of a forward simulation is saved (\texttt{.true.}) or not (\texttt{.false})

\item In section {\bf "\# define models...."}:\\
There are three possible types of models:\\
 \texttt{I}:   (model\_number 1 rho Vp Vs 0 0 Qp Qs 0 0 0 0 0 0) or\\
 \texttt{II}:  (model\_number 2 rho c11 c13 c15 c33 c35 c55 0 0 0 0 0 0) or\\
 \texttt{III}: (model\_number 3 rhos rhof phi c kxx kxz kzz Ks Kf Kfr etaf mufr Qs). \\

For istropic elastic/acoustic material use \texttt{I} and set Vs to zero to make a given model acoustic, for anisotropic elastic use \texttt{II},
and for isotropic poroelastic material use \texttt{III}. The mesh can contain acoustic, elastic, and poroelastic models simultaneously.
rho\_s = solid density\\
rho\_f = fluid density\\
phi = porosity\\
tort = tortuosity\\
permxx = xx component of permeability tensor\\
permxz = xz,zx components of permeability tensor\\
permzz = zz component of permeability tensor\\
kappa\_s = solid bulk modulus\\
kappa\_f= fluid bulk modulus\\
kappa\_fr= frame bulk modulus\\
eta\_f = fluid viscosity\\
mu\_fr = frame shear modulus\\
Qs = shear quality factor\\

Note: for the poroelastic case, mu\_s is irrelevant.
For details on the poroelastic theory see \cite{MoTr08}.

\end{description}

\texttt{get\_poroelastic\_velocities.f90} allows to compute cpI, cpII, and cs function of
the source dominant frequency. Notice that for this calculation we use permxx
and the dominant frequency of the first source , f0(1). Caution if you use
several sources with different frequencies and if you consider anistropic
permeability.

\section{How to obtain Finite Sensitivity Kernels}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] Run a forward simulation: \\
=> \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE = 1} \\
=> \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD = .true.}\\
=> \texttt{seismotype = 1} (we need to save the displacement fields to later on derive the
adjoint source. Note: if the user forgets it, the program corrects it when reading the proper
\texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE} and \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD} combination and a warning message appears in the ouput
file)\\

Important output files (for example, for the elastic case, P-SV waves): \\
\texttt{absorb\_elastic\_bottom*****.bin}\\
\texttt{absorb\_elastic\_left*****.bin}\\
\texttt{absorb\_elastic\_right*****.bin}\\
\texttt{absorb\_elastic\_top*****.bin}\\
\texttt{lastframe\_elastic*****.bin}\\
\texttt{S****.AA.BXX.semd}\\
\texttt{S****.AA.BXZ.semd}\\

\item[2.] Define the adjoint source: \\
Use \texttt{adj\_seismogram.f90}\\
Edit to update \texttt{NSTEP}, \texttt{nrec}, \texttt{t0}, \texttt{deltat}, and the position of the cut to pic
any given phase if needed (\texttt{tstart},\texttt{tend}), add the right number of stations, and
put one component of the source to zero if needed.
The ouput files of \texttt{adj\_seismogram.f90} are \texttt{S****.AA.BXX.adj} and \texttt{S****.AA.BXZ.adj}, for P-SV waves (and
\texttt{S****.AA.BXY.adj}, for SH (membrane) waves). Note that you will need these three
files (\texttt{S****.AA.BXX.adj}, \texttt{S****.AA.BXY.adj} and \texttt{S****.AA.BXZ.adj}) to be present in the \texttt{SEM/} directory
together with the \texttt{absorb\_elastic\_****.bin} and \texttt{lastframe\_elastic.bin} files to be read
when running the adjoint simulation.\\

\item[3.] Run the adjoint simulation: \\
Make sure that the adjoint source files absorbing boundaries and last frame files are
in the \texttt{OUTPUT\_FILES/} directory.\\
=> \texttt{SIMULATION\_TYPE = 2}\\
=> \texttt{SAVE\_FORWARD = .false.}\\

Output files (for example for the elastic case):\\
\texttt{snapshot\_rho\_kappa\_mu*****}\\
\texttt{snapshot\_rhop\_alpha\_beta*****}\\
which are the primary moduli kernels and the phase velocities kernels respectively, in ascii format
and at the local level, that is as "kernels(i,j,ispec)".

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Caution}

Please note that
\begin{itemize}
\item at the moment, adjoint simulations do not support anisotropy, attenuation, and viscous damping.

\item you will need \texttt{S****.AA.BXX.adj}, \texttt{S****.AA.BXY.adj} and \texttt{S****.AA.BXZ.adj}
to be present in directory \texttt{SEM/} even if you are just running an acoustic or
poroelastic adjoint simulation.\\
\texttt{S****.AA.BXX.adj} is the only relevant component for an acoustic case.\\
\texttt{S****.AA.BXX.adj} and \texttt{S****.AA.BXZ.adj} are the only relevant components for a
poroelastic case.
\end{itemize}

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{description}
\item[Regarding the structure of some of the database files] : \newline

{\bf Question:} Can anyone tell me what the columns of the SPECFEM2D boundary
condition files in \texttt{SPECFEM2D/DATA/}~\\
\texttt{Mesh\_canyon} are?\\

\texttt{SPECFEM2D/DATA/Mesh\_canyon/canyon\_absorbing\_surface\_file} \\
\texttt{SPECFEM2D/DATA/Mesh\_canyon/canyon\_free\_surface\_file}

{\bf Answer:} \texttt{canyon\_absorbing\_surface\_file} refers to parameters related to the
absorbing conditions:
The first number (180) is the number of absorbing elements (nelemabs in the
code).
Then the columns are:\\
column 1 = the element number\\
column 2 = the number of nodes of this element that form the absorbing surface\\
column 3 =  the first node\\
column 4 = the second node\\

\texttt{canyon\_free\_surface\_file} refers to the elements of the free surface
(relevant for enforcing free surface condition for acoustic media):
The first number (160) is the number of  elements of the free surface.
Then the columns are (similar to the absorbing case):\\
column 1 = the element number\\
column 2 = the number of nodes of this element that form the absorbing surface\\
column 3 =  the first node\\
column 4 = the second node\\

Concerning the free surface description file, nodes/edges pertaining to
elastic elements are discarded when the file is read (if for whatever
reason it was simpler to include all the nodes/edges on one side of a
studied area and that there are among them some elements that are
elastic elements, only the nodes/edges of acoustic elements are kept).

These files are opened and read in \texttt{meshfem2D.F90} using subroutines
\texttt{read\_abs\_surface()} and \texttt{read\_}~\\
\texttt{acoustic\_surface()}, which are in \texttt{part\_unstruct.F90}
