\textbf{\underline{Evolution of the code:}}\\

version 7.0, Dimitri Komatitsch, Zhinan Xie, Paul Cristini, Roland Martin and Rene Matzen, July 2012:\\
added support for Convolution PML absorbing layers;
added higher-order time schemes (4th order Runge-Kutta and LDDRK4-6);
many small or moderate bug fixes\\

version 6.2, many developers, April 2011:\\
restructured package source code into separate src/ directories;
added configure \& Makefile scripts and a PDF manual in doc/;
added user examples in EXAMPLES/;
added a USER\_T0 parameter to fix the onset time in simulation\\

version 6.1, Christina Morency and Pieyre Le Loher, March 2010:\\
added SH (membrane) waves calculation for elastic media;
added support for external fully anisotropic media;
fixed some bugs in acoustic kernels\\

version 6.0, Christina Morency and Yang Luo, August 2009:\\
support for poroelastic media;
adjoint method for acoustic/elastic/poroelastic\\

version 5.2, Dimitri Komatitsch, Nicolas Le Goff and Roland Martin, February 2008:\\
support for CUBIT and GiD meshes;
MPI implementation of the code based on domain decomposition with METIS or SCOTCH;
general fluid/solid implementation with any number, shape and orientation of matching edges;
fluid potential of density $*$ displacement instead of displacement;
absorbing edges with any normal vector;
general numbering of absorbing and acoustic free surface edges;
cleaned implementation of attenuation as in Carcione (1993);
merged loops in the solver for efficiency;
simplified input of external model;
added CPU time information;
translated many comments from French to English\\

version 5.1, Dimitri Komatitsch, January 2005:\\
more general mesher with any number of curved layers;
Dirac and Gaussian time sources and corresponding convolution routine;
option for acoustic medium instead of elastic;
receivers at any location, not only grid points;
moment-tensor source at any location, not only a grid point;
color snapshots;
more flexible DATA/Par\_file with any number of comment lines;
Xsu scripts for seismograms;
subtract t0 from seismograms;
seismograms and snapshots in pressure in addition to vector field\\

version 5.0, Dimitri Komatitsch, May 2004:\\
got rid of useless routines, suppressed commons etc.;
weak formulation based explicitly on stress tensor;
implementation of full anisotropy;
implementation of attenuation based on memory variables\\
