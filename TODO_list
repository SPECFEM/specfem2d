- splitting file part_unstruct.F90 in several files for clarity purpose.
- improving compiling with SCOTCH (issue with header file scotchf.h which is Fortran77 legal). Having our own scotchf.h file (without the comments) is not wise.
- comparing the different partitioning methods for METIS and SCOTCH, and finding a good default for SCOTCH.
- partitioning using weights for load-balancing.
- choosing a way to use assign_external_model?
- adding comments.
- adding option to create or not STATIONS file (useful for complex geometries like asteroids).
- checking for points with different normals for absorbing conditions, when the absorbing edges are not in the same elements (similar to what is done for the corners).
- scripts for translating GID/CUBIT meshes into files for xmeshfem2D.
- modifying scripts for UPPA cluster (when FS sync issues are solved and remote commands are available).
- manual for unstructured meshes.
- getting rid of constants_unstruct.h.
- enabling use of real or double precision.
- addressing all warnings (particularly with ifort due to symbols that have too many characters).
