  ! note: we use this module definition only to be able to allocate
  !          arrays for receiverlines and materials in this subroutine rather than in the main
  !          routine in meshfem2D.F90

  ! note 2: the filename ending is .F90 to have pre-compilation with pragmas
  !            (like #ifndef USE_MPI) working properly
