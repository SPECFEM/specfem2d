! From array 'surface' (element, type : node/edge, node(s) ) that describes the
! acoustic free surface, determines the points (ixmin, ixmax, izmin and izmax) on the surface
! for each element.
! We chose to have ixmin <= ixmax and izmin <= izmax, so as to be able to have DO loops on it with
! an increment of +1.
