! in case of an acoustic medium, a potential Chi of (density * displacement) is used as in Chaljub and Valette,
! Geophysical Journal International, vol. 158, p. 131-141 (2004) and *NOT* a velocity potential
! as in Komatitsch and Tromp, Geophysical Journal International, vol. 150, p. 303-318 (2002).
! This permits acoustic-elastic coupling based on a non-iterative time scheme.
! Displacement is then: u = grad(Chi) / rho
! Velocity is then: v = grad(Chi_dot) / rho (Chi_dot being the time derivative of Chi)
! and pressure is: p = - Chi_dot_dot  (Chi_dot_dot being the time second derivative of Chi).
! The source in an acoustic element is a pressure source.
! First-order acoustic-acoustic discontinuities are also handled automatically
! because pressure is continuous at such an interface, therefore Chi_dot_dot
! is continuous, therefore Chi is also continuous, which is consistent with
! the spectral-element basis functions and with the assembling process.
! This is the reason why a simple displacement potential u = grad(Chi) would
! not work because it would be discontinuous at such an interface and would
! therefore not be consistent with the basis functions.
