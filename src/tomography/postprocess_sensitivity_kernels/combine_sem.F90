! XCOMBINE_SEM
!
! USAGE
!   mpirun -n NPROC ./bin/xcombine_sem KERNEL_NAMES INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_DIR
!
!
! COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
!   KERNEL_NAMES           - kernel name, e.g. alpha_kernel
!   INPUT_FILE             - text file containing list of kernel directories
!   OUTPUT_PATH            - directory to which summed kernels are written
!
!
! DESCRIPTION
!   For each name in KERNEL_NAMES, sums kernels from directories specified in
!   INPUT_FILE. Writes the resulting sums to OUTPUT_DIR.
!
!   INPUT_FILE is a text file containing a list of absolute or relative paths to
!   kernel direcotires, one directoy per line.
!
!   This program's primary use case is to clip kernels. It can be used though on
!   any scalar field of dimension (NGLLX,NGLLZ,NSPEC).
!
!   This is a parallel program -- it must be invoked with mpirun or other
!   appropriate utility.  Operations are performed in embarassingly-parallel
!   fashion.
