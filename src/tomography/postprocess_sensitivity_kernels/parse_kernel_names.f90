! The following utility function was modified from http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/strtok
!
subroutine strtok (source_string, delimiter, token)

!     @(#) Tokenize a string in a similar manner to C routine strtok(3c).
!
!     Usage:  First call STRTOK() with the string to tokenize as SOURCE_STRING,
!             and the delimiter list used to tokenize SOURCE_STRING in delimiter.
!
!             then, if the returned value is not equal to char(0), keep calling until it is
!             with SOURCE_STRING set to char(0).
!
!            STRTOK will return a token on each call until the entire line is processed,
!            which it signals by returning char(0).
!
!     Input:  source_string =   Source string to tokenize.
!             delimiter    =   delimiter string.  Used to determine the beginning/end of each token in a string.
!
!     Output: strtok()
!
!     LIMITATIONS:
!     can not be called with a different string until current string is totally processed, even from different procedures
