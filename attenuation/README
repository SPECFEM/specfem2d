This example creates the 2D attenuation benchmark of Komatitsch and Tromp (1999, Figure 16).

TO RUN:

0. Read the user manual in SPECFEM2D/doc/manual_SPECFEM2D.pdf

1. in the SPECFEM2D root directory, configure, e.g.,
   ./configure FC=gfortran

2. compile:
   make all

3. cd EXAMPLES/attenuation

4. execute script to run mesher and solver for the PSV case:
   ./process.sh

5. check out the output files in the local directory OUTPUT_FILES; in particular, you can type "gnuplot plot_compare_to_analytical_solution.gnu" to compare the seismograms computed to the quasi-analytical solution of Carcione et al. (1988). 

Note that because our example has no absorbing conditions on the edges of the grid, there are extra (spurious) waves after the main P and S waves, reflected off the edges of the grid, which are not present in the quasi-analytical solution and which you can safely ignore.

Beware that the reference solution is not exact, only quasi-exact (i.e., the formulation uses an approximation, and some integrals are computed numerically) therefore some small discrepancies can be noticed.

More importantly, in the example provided, "tau" relaxation times for attenuation memory variables are recomputed using approximate quality factor targets of Qkappa approximately equal to 27 and Qmu / Qs approximately equal to 20, read (roughly) from Figure 1 page 604 of the article of Carcione et al. (1988). This will NOT lead to the exact same "tau" values as in Table 1 of Carcione et al. (1988). Thus, in order to perform a far more precise comparison to the analytical solution, which is computed using the "tau" values from Table 1 of Carcione et al. (1988), in file "src/specfem2D/attenuation_model.f90" you should impose this instead for this test (only) by uncommenting the following 8 lines:

! tau_epsilon_nu1(1) = 0.0325305d0
! tau_sigma_nu1(1)   = 0.0311465d0
! tau_epsilon_nu2(1) = 0.0332577d0
! tau_sigma_nu2(1)   = 0.0304655d0

! tau_epsilon_nu1(2) = 0.0032530d0
! tau_sigma_nu1(2)   = 0.0031146d0
! tau_epsilon_nu2(2) = 0.0033257d0
! tau_sigma_nu2(2)   = 0.0030465d0
