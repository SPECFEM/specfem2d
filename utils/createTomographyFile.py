Example of external velocity model
Build 1D velocity model and write it in ASCII tomo file that can be read by specfem 2d.
This is the velocity profile set:

                 vmin
               o----------------> velocity (m/s)
               |   |   /
               |   |  /
               |   | /  gradient : -d1
          ZMIN |___|/
               |    \
               |      -
               |        \  gradient : d2
               |          -
               |            \
     Depth (m) v
     
How to use external velocity model in specfem (03/20/2017) :

To set an arbitrary velocity model you have to use the option TOMOGRAPHY_FILE that I have implemented and that you have to set like that in the Par_file when you define the velocity model:

2 -1 9999 9999 9999 9999 9999 9999 9999 0 0 0 0 0 0

# external tomography file
TOMOGRAPHY_FILE                 = ./profile.xyz

The program understand that the velocity model number 2 has to be read in the file profile.xyz as a regular grid it will then deal with the interpolation. You can set what you want in place of the 9999, it does not matter.
The file profile.xyz has to be written under the following format:

  ! The xyz file TOMOGRAPHY_FILE that describe the tomography should be located in the TOMOGRAPHY_PATH
  ! directory, set in the Par_file. The format of the file, as read from define_external_model_from_xyz_file.f90 looks like :
  !
  ! ORIGIN_X ORIGIN_Z END_X END_Z
  ! SPACING_X SPACING_Z
  ! NX NZ
  ! VP_MIN VP_MAX VS_MIN VS_MAX RHO_MIN RHO_MAX
  ! x(1) z(1) vp vs rho
  ! x(2) z(1) vp vs rho
  ! ...
  ! x(NX) z(1) vp vs rho
  ! x(1) z(2) vp vs rho
  ! x(2) z(2) vp vs rho
  ! ...
  ! x(NX) z(2) vp vs rho
  ! x(1) z(3) vp vs rho
  ! ...
  ! ...
  ! x(NX) z(NZ) vp vs rho
  !
  ! Where :
  ! _x and z must be increasing
  ! _ORIGIN_X, END_X are, respectively, the coordinates of the initial and final tomographic
  !  grid points along the x direction (in meters)
  ! _ORIGIN_Z, END_Z are, respectively, the coordinates of the initial and final tomographic
  !  grid points along the z direction (in meters)
  ! _SPACING_X, SPACING_Z are the spacing between the tomographic grid points along the x
  !  and z directions, respectively (in meters)
  ! _NX, NZ are the number of grid points along the spatial directions x and z,
  !  respectively; NX is given by [(END_X - ORIGIN_X)/SPACING_X]+1; NZ is the same as NX, but
  !  for z direction.
  ! _VP_MIN, VP_MAX, VS_MIN, VS_MAX, RHO_MIN, RHO_MAX are the minimum and maximum values of
  !  the wave speed vp and vs (in m.s-1) and of the density rho (in kg.m-3); these values
  !  could be the actual limits of the tomographic parameters in the grid or the minimum
  !  and maximum values to which we force the cut of velocity and density in the model.
  ! _After these first four lines, in the file file_name the tomographic grid points are
  !  listed with the corresponding values of vp, vs and rho, scanning the grid along the x
  !  coordinate (from ORIGIN_X to END_X with step of SPACING_X) for each given z (from ORIGIN_Z
  !  to END_Z, with step of SPACING_Z).

This is a working script writing such file for a 1D profile (velocity depending just on depth). Read carefully all the comments but in particular the lines containing "!!WARNING!!" that I have added for
people who need range dependent models.

run that script ./createTomographyFile.py and look at the file profile.xyz created.

In the case of range dependent models vp, vs and rho will be 2D arrays, you have to modify that.

For the moment just one model can be read from an external file but it is not very difficult to implement that. Likewise viscoelastic parameters can not vary with position for now.
