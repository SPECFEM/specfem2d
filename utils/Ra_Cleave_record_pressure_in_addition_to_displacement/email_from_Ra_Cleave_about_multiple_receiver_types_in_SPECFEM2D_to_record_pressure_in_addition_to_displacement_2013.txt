Dimitri,

Here are the routines I have modified. As I mentioned the code now optionally
records pressure at each receiver. Most changes are preceded by a comment that
starts with "!RC:". The par_file needs to have the following line:

seismo_p = .true.         # Whether pressure should also be recorded

Files:
SPECFEM2D-7.0.0-RC/src/specfem2D/write_seismograms.F90
SPECFEM2D-7.0.0-RC/src/specfem2D/specfem2D.F90
SPECFEM2D-7.0.0-RC/src/specfem2D/read_databases.f90

SPECFEM2D-7.0.0-RC/src/meshfem2D/read_parameter_file.F90
SPECFEM2D-7.0.0-RC/src/meshfem2D/save_databases.f90

Best regards,
Ra
