SPECFEM2D/DATA/EXAMPLES/README_EXAMPLES

This directory contains a set of examples for testing purposes.

1. M2_UPPA     -- internal mesh with smooth topographic interfaces
2. fluid_solid -- external mesh, fluid, solid, and topography
3. Tromp2005   -- internal mesh, from Tromp, Tape, Liu (GJI 2005)
4. Tape2007    -- internal mesh, from Tape, Liu, Tromp (GJI 2007)

Each example requires a Par_file, SOURCE, and either a file of interfaces
OR an external mesh.

The default example is M2_UPPA. To run a different example, you must
over-write the SOURCE and Par_file. For example, from DATA:

cp EXAMPLES/fluid_solid/Par_file_fluid_soild Par_file
cp EXAMPLES/fluid_solid/SOURCE_fluid_solid SOURCE

The directory DATA_to_sort contains additional examples that have yet
to be sorted into folders as formal examples.
