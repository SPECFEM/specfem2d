Examples for Tromp-Tape-Liu (GJI 2005)

The subscript s100 is the same set of simulations but scaled down in size by a factor of 100. This requires increasing the source frequency content and decreasing the time step.

In Tromp2005 there is a time shift of 8 s before the source starts.
This is not yet implemented.
