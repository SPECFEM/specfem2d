# SPECFEM2D

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/14293189.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7434515)

SPECFEM2D allows users to perform 2D and 2.5D (i.e., axisymmetric) simulations
of acoustic, elastic, viscoelastic, and poroelastic seismic wave propagation.
The package can also be used for full waveform imaging (FWI) or adjoint tomography.


SPECFEM2D was founded by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp, and is now being developed by a large, collaborative, and inclusive community. A complete list of authors can be found at

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and use `SPECFEM2D` are
available in the

- PDF manual located in directory: [doc/USER_MANUAL](doc/USER_MANUAL).

- HTML manual (latest version): [specfem2d.readthedocs.io](http://specfem2d.readthedocs.io/)

For a quick test, run the default example with these commands:
```
./configure FC=gfortran
make all
./bin/xmeshfem2D
./bin/xspecfem2D
```
and check the output files in `./OUTPUT_FILES/`

>__NOTE__: Do not modify the 'configure' script directly. Please modify the 
    'configure.ac' file instead, and generate a new 'configure' script with 
    the command: `autoreconf -i`

SPECFEM2D is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members â€” i.e., including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive and
participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating! We have collected a set of guidelines and advice on how to get
involved in the community and keep them in the specfem3d github wiki:
