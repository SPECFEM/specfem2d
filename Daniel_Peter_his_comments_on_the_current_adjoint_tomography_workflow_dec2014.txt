Hi Carl,

for 1.
i kept the routines very similar, some differences occur when reading in mesh files and e.g. where the maximum of the gradient is taken for the update step length. in future, i want to have them also merged into the same set of SPECFEM function library.

for 2.
good point, the jacobian is used for smoothing of the kernels in the global code, but isn't currently used for the cartesian code. that is one of the differences that has to be checked again (thus smoothing in the cartesian is based solely on point distance, not volume)

best wishes,
daniel
