For more details on how to use this code, users can also refer to the manuals
of the 3D versions (SPECFEM3D and SPECFEM3D_GLOBE), which contain far
more detailed descriptions of the spectral-element method.

---------------------------

- partitioning using weights for load-balancing.

- checking for points with different normals for absorbing conditions, when the absorbing edges are not in the same elements (similar to what is done for the corners).

------------------------------

SOMETHING THAT COULD BE MADE MORE GENERAL:

at line 770 of specfem2D.F90:
!! DK DK if needed in the future, here the quality factor could be different for each point

i.e. they could be given at each (i,j,ispec) instead of at each (ispec) only
in the current version. Very easy to do if needed, just that line to change.
