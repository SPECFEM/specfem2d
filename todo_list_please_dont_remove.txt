- in createnum_fast.f90 we should replace the heuristic computation of the minimum
threshold distance:
!
! compute the minimum typical "size" of an element in the mesh
  xtypdist = min(xtypdist,xmaxval-xminval)
  xtypdist = min(xtypdist,ymaxval-yminval)
!
with a more general algorithm based on the actual distance (i.e., using sqrt()
instead of an estimate of the horizontal and vertical sizes only; because otherwise
very distorted elements may lead to erroneous results)

- splitting file part_unstruct.F90 in several files for clarity purpose.

- improving compiling with SCOTCH (issue with header file scotchf.h which is Fortran77 legal). Having our own scotchf.h file (without the comments) is not wise.

- comparing the different partitioning methods for METIS and SCOTCH, and finding a good default for SCOTCH.

- partitioning using weights for load-balancing.

- choosing a way to use assign_external_model?

- adding comments.

- checking for points with different normals for absorbing conditions, when the absorbing edges are not in the same elements (similar to what is done for the corners).

- scripts for translating GID/CUBIT meshes into files for xmeshfem2D.

- modifying scripts for UPPA cluster (when FS sync issues are solved and remote commands are available).

- manual for unstructured meshes.

- getting rid of constants_unstruct.h.

- checking use of real or double precision. Gain in elapsed time is ok, but now we have to look for memory consumption.

- checking output on stdout (for data that should be printed only once).

- Hi Jeroen, Perfect. I think talking to Jean-Paul Ampuero would be useful
as well because in Utrecht last year he had told us that
he had implemented some nice 4th-order symplectic schemes
in his version of SEM2D. Dimitri.
